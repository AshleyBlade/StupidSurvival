# StupidSurvival
A small plugin that adds a bunch of random things to Minecraft.

List of things it includes:
  Exploding blocks
  Invisible mobs
  Zombies spawning from dead villagers
  Phantom's playing sounds when they spawn
  RTP'ing when exiting a bed
  Creeper sounds when breaking blocks
  "Hardcore" inventory -> when you die all items get destroyed but you can respawn
  Chance of Endermite spawning when opening a chest
  When a sheep dies angry wolves chase you
  When a pig dies it's family tries to get revenge
  When a llama dies it spawns a "Special" trader
  When an Iron Golem hits it strikes lightning
  When you sleep you have a chance of Ilay spawning and stealing your items, he will try to run away and drop gold when you hit them

All of the above things happen randomly and aren't easily configurable yet, this is a plugin designed for me, I will probably end up adding a config file for all the odds of the above in the future!
